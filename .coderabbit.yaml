# CodeRabbit Configuration for Crossplane Runtime
# This configuration is optimized for the Crossplane Runtime Go library

# =============================================================================
# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# =============================================================================

# Language for CodeRabbit reviews and comments (default: en-US, keeping explicit)
language: "en-US"

# Instructions for CodeRabbit's tone and style in reviews (max 250 chars)
tone_instructions: |
  Be collaborative and supportive. Ask clarifying questions rather than making
  assumptions. Focus on the 'why' behind decisions. Frame concerns
  constructively and thank contributors.

  # We tested assertive and found it too verbose, e.g. approxing 200 comments on
  # https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/pull/6777. Some of the nitpicks do
  # look valuable to me, but the signal to noise ratio isn't good enough.

  # Path-specific instructions for different areas of the codebase
  path_instructions:
    - path: "**/*.go"
      instructions: |
        Enforce Crossplane-specific patterns: Use crossplane-runtime/pkg/errors
        for wrapping. Check variable naming (short for local scope, descriptive
        for wider scope). Ensure 'return early' pattern. Verify error scoping
        (declare in conditionals when possible). For nolint directives, require
        specific linter names and explanations. CRITICAL: Ensure all error
        messages are meaningful to end users, not just developers - avoid
        technical jargon, include context about what the user was trying to do,
        and suggest next steps when possible.
    
    - path: "**/*_test.go"
      instructions: |
        Enforce table-driven test structure: PascalCase test names (no
        underscores), args/want pattern, use cmp.Diff with
        cmpopts.EquateErrors() for error testing. Check for proper test case
        naming and reason fields. Ensure no third-party test frameworks (no
        Ginkgo, Gomega, Testify).
    
    - path: "**/*.md"
      instructions: |
        Ensure Markdown files are wrapped at 100 columns for consistency and
        readability. Lines can be longer if it makes links more readable, but
        otherwise should wrap at 100 characters. Check for proper heading
        structure, clear language, and that documentation is helpful for users.
    
    - path: "**/apis/**"
      instructions: |
        Focus on API design following Kubernetes API conventions from
        https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md.
        Check for proper field naming (camelCase), appropriate types, validation
        tags, and documentation. Ask about backward compatibility and the impact
        on existing users and upgrade paths. Consider if changes need feature
        gates or alpha/beta graduation. Ensure error messages in validation are
        user-friendly. Pay attention to API consistency, proper use of optional
        vs required fields, and following established Kubernetes patterns.
    
    - path: "**/pkg/reconciler/**"
      instructions: |
        Review reconciler logic for proper reconciliation patterns, error
        handling, and resource management. Pay special attention to conditions
        and events: Conditions must be actionable for users (not developers),
        stable/deterministic, with proper Type/Reason/Message format. Events
        only when something actually happens, with specific details about what
        changed. No transient errors in conditions/events. All error messages
        must be meaningful to end users - include context about what
        resource/operation failed and why.
    
    - path: "**/test/**"
      instructions: |
        Focus on test coverage, test clarity, and proper use of testing
        utilities. Ask about testing scenarios and edge cases. Ensure tests are
        maintainable and cover the happy path and error conditions. Verify
        error testing uses proper patterns (cmpopts.EquateErrors, sentinel
        errors for complex cases).

        instructions: |
          Fails if any public Go code (exported functions, types, methods, or
          fields) in '**/*.go' (excluding *_test.go and generated files) is
          removed, renamed, has signature changes, or has behavior changes that
          could break existing users, without the 'breaking-change' label. This
          is a library repo - all exported APIs are public.
